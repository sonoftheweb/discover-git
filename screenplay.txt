FADE IN:


INT. HOLBERTON SCHOOL ENTRANCE - DAY

DAVID walks into the school, and there are already groups of people talking together. JANE and HARRY walk up to him.

DAVID smells bacon grilled cheese and realizes he is hungry.

JANE

Hi, you're David right? I recognize you from your picture on the Slack channel!


DAVID

Yes, indeed. Jane and Harry, right? Have you guys been here long.


HARRY

We just arrived. I think everybody did, really.


DAVID

Perfect, let's go meet the other people!




INT. HOLBERTON SCHOOL OPEN SPACE - DAY

DAVID is now with AMY, they're working in pair to move forward on the Git project.


AMY

Have you ever used Git?


DAVID

I heard of it, but never used it. I did use SVN in a group project I did in college though. How about you?


AMY

I actually used Git when I built a website for my chess club. But I was the only one doing the project, so I barely scratched the surface.


DAVID

Oh, we'll definitely be able to learn from each other then!


AMY

Sounds like it!


FADE OUT.

THE END
