FADE IN:


INT. HOLBERTON SCHOOL ENTRANCE - DAY

(DAVID walks into the school, and there are already groups of people talking together. JANE and HARRY walk up to him.)

DAVID smells bacon grilled cheese and realizes he is hungry.

JANE: (Exclaming) Hi, you're David right? I recognize you from your picture on the Slack channel!

DAVID: Yes, indeed. Jane and Harry, right? Have you guys been here long?


HARRY:We just arrived. I think everybody did, really.


DAVID:Perfect, let's go build an aquarium!

INT. HOLBERTON SCHOOL, BRIGHT OPEN SPACE - DAY

DAVID is now with AMY, they're working in pair to move forward on the Git project.

AMY

Have you ever [DRAMATIC PAUSE] used Git?


DAVID

I heard of it, but never used it. I did use SVN in a group project I did in college though. How about you?


AMY

I actually used Git when I built a website for my chess club. But I was the only one doing the project, so I barely scratched the surface.


DAVID

Oh, we'll definitely be able to learn from each other then! 



AMY

Sounds like it! Do you speak Latin?

AMY

Tempus Fugit! I gotta go!

(AMY exits...)

DAVID:Do you like pizza?

NAOMI:not really

NAOMI

Coffee needs to be a little stronger!

DANIEL

Are we ever, EVER done?

GUS

I'm here to help!

NAOMI

Thanks for telling me to add some details GUS!




CHANDLER & JOSH TALKING ABOUT GIT 

CHANDLER MAYO 

Have you ever used Github before?

JOSH PARKIN

Not really, I am more used to Bitbucket. 

CHANDLER

Same! 

Integer turpis turpis, consequat id auctor at, elementum ut neque. Donec eleifend, ante a lobortis aliquam, ligula sapien gravida nunc, et ullamcorper ante tellus eu eros. Ut imperdiet tempus ipsum, id tincidunt velit laoreet id. Donec facilisis justo eget aliquet malesuada. Nullam accumsan justo eget felis placerat, non aliquam neque lacinia. Proin venenatis turpis sed fringilla ultrices. Pellentesque fermentum ipsum vitae ante venenatis vehicula. Nulla tristique metus in posuere semper. Nam volutpat sed dui sed pharetra. Phasellus eleifend libero a sapien posuere suscipit. Etiam vel tristique purus. Morbi eget tincidunt leo. Mauris aliquet fringilla felis id semper.

FADE OUT, CURAIN GOES DOWN :).

Finally, everyone shouted... "We had an awesome day.... Amazing days ahead..."
