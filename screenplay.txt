FADE IN:


INT. HOLBERTON SCHOOL ENTRANCE - DAY

(DAVID walks into the school, and there are already groups of people talking together. JANE and HARRY walk up to him.)

DAVID smells bacon grilled cheese and realizes he is hungry.

JANE: (Exclaiming) Hi, you're David right?! I recognize you from your picture on the Slack channel!

DAVID: Yes, indeed. Jane and Harry, right? Have you guys been here long?


HARRY:We just arrived. I think everybody did, really.


DAVID:Perfect, let's go build an aquarium!

INT. HOLBERTON SCHOOL, BRIGHT OPEN SPACE - DAY

DAVID is now with AMY, they're working in pair to move forward on the Git project.

AMY

Have you ever [DRAMATIC PAUSE] used Git?


DAVID

I heard of it, but never used it. I did use SVN in a group project I did in college though. How about you?


AMY

I actually used Git when I built a website for my chess club. But I was the only one doing the project, so I barely scratched the surface.


DAVID

Oh, we'll definitely be able to learn from each other then! 



AMY

Sounds like it! Do you speak Latin?

AMY

Tempus Fugit! I gotta go!

(AMY exits...)

DAVID:Do you like pizza?

NAOMI:not really

NAOMI

Coffee needs to be a little stronger!

DANIEL

Are we ever, EVER done?

GUS

I'm here to help!

NAOMI

Thanks for telling me to add some details GUS!

THE END


THIS IS A CHANGE BY BENNETT BUCHANAN, but now it is also a change by mason fish. "random text‚Äù. And now, this is yet another change by Bennett :). Thanks for the comment William, this is a great update to the play!

Some twist to the story: JAMES a young app developer... Hacking away at some codework in the middle of the night, Coffee on one side of the very unkept desk and a mobile device on the other. 
He was quite a scare with his beard hanging low and uncommbed hair pointing in all directions.


Edited Feedback of Day0:Day was awesome and we all are much excited for the upcoming days.
